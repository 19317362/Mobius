                      <!-- Fix java.lang.SecurityException being thrown, when the uber jar is executed.
                      Details: Some dependency jar files are signed jar files.  A jar file is signed by using jarsigner, 
                               which creates 2 additional files and places them in META-INF: (1) a signature file, 
                               with a .SF extension, and (2) a signature block file, with a .DSA, .RSA, or .EC extension.  
                               Since the uber-jar file is created, the signatures and integrity of signed JAR files are no longer 
                               valid.  When the uber-jar file is executed, java.lang.SecurityException is thrown. -->
